📍HTML(Hypertext Make-Up Language)
This section of my development has to with:
🏷️ putting the text content together; which this project didn't call for much of that because of the use of other resourse.HTML is a very powerful language which dynamically give the developer the opportunity to break the project they are working on into section or div, which help the styling and positioning of elements and contents

📍CSS(Casecading Style Sheet)
🏷️ Styling is really important when it comes to development of an app/website.when i was developing this project i didn't want to use normal css but wanted to use 💡SASS because SASS gives you the developer the opportunity to do nested styling, using variables to store common styling, use functions and so on which is reallt really awesome.Sass really reduced my work load; it compiles the sass into normal sass.
